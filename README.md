In order to be able to run this test Gradle and ChromeDriver are needed.

I recommend [Brew](https://brew.sh/) to install both dependencies:
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
* Chromedriver: `brew install chromedriver`
  * Then to Chromedriver should be started:  `$ chromedriver`

To execute the test just run: `gradle test`
